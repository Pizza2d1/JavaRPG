# CS1410 Final Project
This is where we will be storing out final project for our cs1410 class where we will be making a game using JFrame and KeyEvents.
___

## Vision (might change)
We want to make a top-down styled videogame where you are able to explore a world as the protagonist while being able to attack enemies that you find along the way, a lot like the original Legend of Zelda.
## Things to be done:

[x]: Make player movement respond to keyboard
[ ]: Make player, background and enemy sprites
[ ]: Add hurtboxes/hitboxes for player and enemies
[ ]: Add a way to move the map as a way to explore (player in center at all times)
[ ]: Make a way to create the maps easily (create seperate program for that)
[ ]: Add motion to the enemies so they move towards you
[ ]: Animate the enemies
[ ]: Make a boss enemy

## Project contributions
Since this is being done by multiple people, it is best practice to learn how git/github works with its branches, for this project we will be using a

```
project ---o---> addition1 ---o---> beta_addition1
            \
             \--> addition2 ---o---> beta_addition2

```

Where each of the additions that we want to make will first be tested in a beta branch, then check to make sure it fits with the current project by using the addition branch, and if it works, we can merge it to the project branch which is tested and working code. This makes it easier to work on stuff seperately and makes it easier to understand who is working on what.
